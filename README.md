This is a fun game.
Guess the 5 letter word, you have 6 chances.
if you guess the letter wrong, that box turns in grey color.
if you guess the letter correctly, then it turns yellow.
if you guess all the letter correctly that means you guessed the word, the whole row turns, green and you won.
i just hardcoded the word (just coded for fun) but for further development we can use an API to generate 5 letter words and take it as the word to guess.
